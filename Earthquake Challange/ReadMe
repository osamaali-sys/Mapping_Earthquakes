# Mapping_Earthquakes

# RESOURCES

HTML, Javascript, CSS, GeoJSON, Leflet.js and MapBox

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Results

We created a map to showcase last 7 days of earthquakes and tectonic plates. We also created an overlay to toggle different types of maps and earthquake and tectonic data.
